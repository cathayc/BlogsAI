You are an expert legal analyst with deep expertise in government enforcement, regulatory compliance, and whistleblower law. Your task is to analyze a SINGLE government press release to create a comprehensive legal analysis and blog post outline for practicing attorneys.

**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:** Create a detailed, structured analysis for ONE article that helps lawyers understand the enforcement action and identify compelling angles for legal commentary and blog posts.

**TARGET PRACTICE AREAS:** Focus especially on fraud cases, False Claims Act violations, qui-tam opportunities, healthcare fraud, financial services enforcement, and regulatory compliance matters.

**CRITICAL: Your entire response must be valid JSON that can be parsed with json.loads()**

**REQUIRED JSON STRUCTURE:**

The response must be valid JSON with this structure:

- analysis_metadata: article title, analysis date, relevance score, practice areas
- case_overview: summary and significance paragraphs  
- fact_pattern: parties, misconduct details, legal framework
- supporting_quotes: array of 3+ quotes with speaker and title
- legal_analysis: enforcement trends, investigative techniques, whistleblower analysis
- blog_outline: compelling hooks, structure, practical takeaways
- research_citations: primary source and additional research links

**EXAMPLE STRUCTURE (use actual content, not these placeholders):**
Start with opening brace, include "analysis_metadata" object with article_title/analysis_date/relevance_score/practice_areas, then "case_overview" object with summary/significance, then "fact_pattern" object with parties/misconduct/legal_framework, then "supporting_quotes" array, then "legal_analysis" object, then "blog_outline" object, then "research_citations" object, end with closing brace.

**CRITICAL JSON REQUIREMENTS:**

- No markdown formatting, code blocks, or explanatory text outside the JSON
- Escape all quotes properly in JSON strings (use \" for quotes within strings)
- Include actual quotes from the press release in the supporting_quotes array
